You are a master of image content recognition. You need to extract the key objects in the caption, look for those key objects in the picture, and then tell me if those key objects are included in the picture.Your task is described as follows:
Extract the key entities from the title and locate those key entities in the picture.
For each key object identified in the previous step, use precise spatial imagination to determine the specific area in the image where each object is allocated, segment the image into several areas, and number them starting from 0.The area refers to dividing the entire image into different regions for a general layout.Each key entities is assigned to a area.This layout should segment the image and strictly follow the method below:
a. Determine whether the image is divided into multiple rows by key objects (It should be noted that a single entity should not be split into different rows, except when describing different parts of a person like the head, clothes/body, and lower garment):
• If so, segment the image into several rows and assign an identifier to each row from top to bottom (e.g., Row0, Row1, ...).
• Identify the percentage of height each row occupies within the image (e.g., Row0 (height=0.33) indicates that the row occupies 33% of the height of the entire upper portion of the image).

b. Within each row, further assess the need for division into multiple regions (it should be noted that each region should contain only one entity):
• If required, divide each row from left to right into several blocks and assign a number to each block (e.g., Region0, Region1, ...).
• Identify the percentage of width each block occupies within its respective row (e.g., Region0 (Row0, width=0.5) denotes that the block is located in Row0 and occupies 50% of the width of that row's left side).

c. Output the overall ratio along with the key objects:
• First, combine each row's height separated by semicolons like Row0_height; Row1_height; ...; Rown_height. If there is only one row, skip this step.
• Secondly, attach each row's regions' width after each row's height separated with commas, like Row0_height,Row0_region0_width,Row0_region1_width,...Row0_regionm_width;Row1_height,Row1_region0_width,...;Rown_height,...Rown_regionj_width.
• If the row doesn't have more than one region, just continue to the next row.
• It should be noted that we should use decimal representation in the overall ratio, and if there is only one row, just omit the row ratio.

Please go a step further and regenerate the layout for me. I need you to supplement the description of key object with detailed imagination and create logical descriptions. Then, add logically appropriate background objects between the entities. Finally, redesign the layout. Your task description is as follows:
For each key object in the region, give it a more detailed description based on the original text.Imagine several background objects related to the key objects and provide detailed descriptions for them as well.
a. If the key entities appear in the same row, add a column between them, and fill the additional space with background objects.

b. If the key entities appear in the same column, add a row between them and fill the additional space with background objects.

c. If the key entities are in different rows and columns, add either a row or a column between them, and fill the additional space with background objects.

d. Output the overall ratio along with the regional prompts:
• First, combine each row's height separated by semicolons like Row0_height; Row1_height; ...; Rown_height. If there is only one row, skip this step.
• Secondly, attach each row's regions' width after each row's height separated with commas, like Row0_height,Row0_region0_width,Row0_region1_width,...Row0_regionm_width;Row1_height,Row1_region0_width,...;Rown_height,...Rown_regionj_width.
• If the row doesn't have more than one region, just continue to the next row.
• It should be noted that we should use decimal representation in the overall ratio, and if there is only one row, just omit the row ratio.
The output should follow the format of the examples below:
