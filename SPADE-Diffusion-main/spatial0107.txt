### Key entities identification:
The caption identifies the following key entity:
- A boy, with the specific attribute of being on top of a wallet.

Since there is only one key entity, we'll need to split the image to separately depict the boy and the wallet in a way that highlights the spatial relationship.

### Plan the structure split for the image:

#### a. Rows
For visual clarity and to emphasize the positioning of the boy on the wallet, we will split the image into two rows:
- **Row0 (height=0.4):** This row will occupy the top 40% of the image, focusing on the boy.
- **Row1 (height=0.6):** This row will occupy the bottom 60% of the image, featuring the wallet.

#### b. Regions within rows
Since each row contains only one distinct entity, each row serves as a single region.

- **Region0 (Row0, width=1):** The boy is depicted as playfully seated or reclining on the wallet, with an expression of curiosity or mischief. His attire is casual, perhaps a t-shirt and shorts, with tousled hair, capturing a youthful energy.
  
- **Region1 (Row1, width=1):** The wallet is a leather one, possibly showing signs of wear and sophistication. The texture is detailed, with light glinting off its surface, giving it an air of reliability and durability. 

#### c. Overall ratio:
While we have two rows, we don't split them into different regions, just specifying the height they occupy. Since each row has only one entity, we omit the region width specification:

- **Final split ratio: 0.6,0.3,0.4,0.3;0.4,0.7,0.3
