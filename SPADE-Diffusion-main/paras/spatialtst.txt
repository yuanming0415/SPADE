Regional Prompt: A ceiling-mounted pendant light hanging centrally, matte metal canopy, warm bulb enclosed by frosted glass, casting downward light cones that emphasize the center of the room below. BREAK A smooth, clean wall surface painted in matte white, no decoration or frames, evenly lit by natural light, showing faint texture of plaster beneath. BREAK A two-seat upholstered sofa against the left wall, low backrest, broad cushions showing gentle use, armrest slightly curved outward, fabric in soft gray that absorbs rather than reflects light. BREAK A flat television screen mounted on the right side wall, black bezel, powered on with a dim menu interface visible, angled slightly inward so its surface faces the seating position across from it. BREAK A soft rectangular area rug covering the floor in the foreground, woven fibers in layered beige and charcoal stripes, edges lying flat, corners aligned neatly, showing no visible wear or curling. BREAK A potted floor plant placed near the lower right foreground, broad dark green leaves extending upward and outward, ceramic planter resting directly on the floor beside the rug’s boundary.
