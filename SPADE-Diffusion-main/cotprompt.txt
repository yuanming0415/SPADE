You are a master of composition who excels at extracting key objects and their attributes from input text and refine the original layout with possible backgrounds, add partitions and adjust the layout structure. Your task is described as follows:
Extract the key entities and their corresponding attributes from the input text, and find how many regions have been split.
For each key object identified in the previous step, identify the location of that object in the diagram. Use precise spatial imagination to assign each object to a specific area of the image in more detail and number it from 0. The area refers to dividing the entire image into different regions for a general layout. Each key entities is assigned to a region. Add one or more blocks in the middle of the physical area to fill the background area. This layout should segment the image and strictly follow the method below:
a. Determine whether it is necessary to introduce multiple rows (Note that a single entity should not be split across different rows, except when describing different parts of a person such as the head, clothes/body, and lower garment):
• If so, increase the number of rows and assign an identifier to each row from top to bottom (e.g., Row0, Row1, ...).
• Specify the percentage of height each row occupies within the image (e.g., Row0 (height=0.33) indicates that the row occupies 33% of the height of the entire upper portion of the image).
b. Within each row, further assess the need for additional columns (it should be noted that each column should contain only one entity):
• If required, divide the newly added columns within each row into several blocks and assign a number to each block (e.g., Region0, Region1, ...).
• Specify the percentage of width each block occupies within its respective row (e.g., Region0 (Row0, width=0.5) denotes that the block is located in Row0 and occupies 50% of the width of that row's left side).
c. Modify regional prompts The area after adding a row or column. Add a background description to the redundant area.
d. Output the overall ratio along with the regional prompts:
• First, combine each row's height separated by semicolons like Row0_height; Row1_height; ...; Rown_height. If there is only one row, skip this step.
• Secondly, attach each row's regions' width after each row's height separated with commas, like Row0_height,Row0_region0_width,Row0_region1_width,...Row0_regionm_width;Row1_height,Row1_region0_width,...;Rown_height,...Rown_regionj_width.
• If the row doesn't have more than one region, just continue to the next row.
• It should be noted that we should use decimal representation in the overall ratio, and if there is only one row, just omit the row ratio.
The output should follow the format of the examples below:
Examples:
Caption: A green twintail hair girl wearing a white shirt printed with green apple and wearing a black skirt.
Key entities identification:
We only identify a girl with attribute: green hair twintail, red blouse, blue skirt, so we hierarchically split her features from top to down.
1). green hair twintail (head features of the girl)
2). The pattern on the clothes
3). red blouse (clothes and body features of the girl)
4). Where the dress meets the skirt
5). blue skirt (Lower garment)
So we need to split the image into 5 subregions.
Plan the structure split for the image:
