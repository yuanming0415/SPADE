The area refers to dividing the entire image into different regions for a general layout. Each key entities is assigned to a region. And for each entity in the region, give it a more detailed description based on the original text. This layout should segment the image and strictly follow the method below:\n",
      " a. Determine if the image needs to be divided into multiple rows (It should be noted that a single entity should not be split into different rows, except when describing different parts of a person like the head, clothes/body, and lower garment):\n",
      " • If so, segment the image into several rows and assign an identifier to each row from top to bottom (e.g., Row0, Row1,...).\n",
      " • Specify the percentage of height each row occupies within the image (e.g., Row0 (height=0.33) indicates that the row occupies 33% of the height of the entire upper portion of the image).\n",
      " b. Within each row, further assess the need for division into multiple regions (it should be noted that each region should contain only one entity):\n",
      " • If required, divide each row from left to right into several blocks and assign a number to each block (e.g., Region0, Region1,...).\n",
      " • Specify the percentage of width each block occupies within its respective row (e.g., Region0 (Row0, width=0.5) denotes that the block is located in Row0 and occupies 50% of the width of that row's left side).\n",
      " c. Output the overall ratio along with the regional prompts:\n",
      " • First, combine each row's height separated by semicolons like Row0_height; Row1_height;...; Rown_height. If there is only one row, skip this step.\n",
      " • Secondly, attach each row's regions' width after each row's height separated with commas, like Row0_height,Row0_region0_width,Row0_region1_width,...Row0_regionm_width;Row1_height,Row1_region0_width,...;Rown_height,...Rown_regionj_width.\n",
      " • If the row doesn't have more than one region, just continue to the next row.\n",
      " • It should be noted that we should use decimal representation in the overall ratio, and if there is only one row, just omit the row ratio.\n",
