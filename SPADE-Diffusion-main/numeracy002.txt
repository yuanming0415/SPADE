To address the caption "six airplanes," we first identify the key entities and their attributes:

Key entities identification:
1. Airplane 1 (an aircraft, unspecified attributes)
2. Airplane 2 (an aircraft, unspecified attributes)
3. Airplane 3 (an aircraft, unspecified attributes)
4. Airplane 4 (an aircraft, unspecified attributes)
5. Airplane 5 (an aircraft, unspecified attributes)
6. Airplane 6 (an aircraft, unspecified attributes)

Since no specific attributes are given for the airplanes, we will need to imagine details for each entity. We will split the image into six regions to represent each airplane visually.

Plan the structure split for the image:

a. Rows
Considering that we have six key entities and no specific attributes to separate vertically, we should aim for a layout that allows for even distribution across a grid format. For simplicity and better arrangement, let's design the layout to have two rows, each encompassing three airplanes.

- Row0 (height=0.5): This row will occupy the top half of the image, showing the first three airplanes.
- Row1 (height=0.5): This row will occupy the bottom half of the image, featuring the remaining three airplanes.

b. Regions within rows
We will divide each row into three regions to represent each airplane:

- Region0 (Row0, width=0.33): This region will capture Airplane 1, imagined soaring through a clear blue sky, the sunlight glinting off its sleek metallic surface.
- Region1 (Row0, width=0.33): This region will capture Airplane 2, flying at a different altitude, with contrails trailing behind in the backdrop of fluffy white clouds.
- Region2 (Row0, width=0.33): This region will capture Airplane 3, flying in formation, with bold colors on its wings, cutting through the crisp air.

- Region3 (Row1, width=0.33): This region will capture Airplane 4, gliding smoothly, with vivid tail fins and engines humming against a serene sunset.
- Region4 (Row1, width=0.33): This region will capture Airplane 5, banking sharply, leaving a streak of vapor in its swift maneuver, with the earth's curvature faint in the background.
- Region5 (Row1, width=0.33): This region will capture Airplane 6, gracefully ascending, its undercarriage visible, casting a shadow below against a golden horizon.

c. Overall ratio:
Row0_height,Row0_region0_width,Row0_region1_width,Row0_region2_width;Row1_height,Row1_region3_width,Row1_region4_width,Row1_region5_width

Final split ratio: 0.4;0.2;0.4

Regional Prompt: A classic clock with an ornate round face sits elegantly atop the sheep. Its gold-accented hands and numbers gleam softly, lending a timeless elegance to the rustic scene. BREAK It's a prairie. BREAK The sheep, with its soft and fluffy wool, stands calmly beneath the clock. Its gentle eyes seem to survey the lush, pastoral surroundings, complete with wildflowers and swaying grasses in the serene morning light.
