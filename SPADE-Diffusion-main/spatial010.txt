To process the caption "a bird on the left of a microwave," we begin by identifying the key entities and their attributes:

### Key Entities Identification:
1. **Bird**: The only attribute is its position, "on the left."
2. **Microwave**: No specific attributes are detailed beyond its position relative to the bird.

Given these entities, we will split the image into the appropriate regions as follows:

### Plan the Structure Split for the Image:

#### a. Rows
Since there are two key entities with distinct spatial relationships (the bird being on the left of the microwave), we will organize them horizontally within a single row:

- **Row0 (height=1)**: Contains the entire scene including both the bird and the microwave. This row occupies 100% of the image height since there are no vertical separations needed.

#### b. Regions within Rows
We need to divide this single row into two regions, one for each entity:

- **Region0 (Row0, width=0.5)**: This region will be dedicated to the bird positioned on the left side of the image. For additional detail, we might imagine a small domesticated bird with glossy feathers, perched confidently, its bright eyes scanning the room.
  
- **Region1 (Row0, width=0.5)**: This region will cover the microwave on the right side. Let's imagine it as a sleek, modern appliance with a shiny metallic finish, reflecting the light and resting securely on the kitchen counter.

#### c. Overall Ratio:
Since this layout contains only one row with two regions, we omit the row ratios and directly provide the widths of the regions within the row.

- **Final split ratio: 0.5,0.5

### Regional Prompt: A small domesticated bird with glossy feathers perched confidently on the counter, its bright eyes scanning the room. BREAK A sleek, modern microwave with a shiny metallic finish, reflecting the light and resting securely on the kitchen counter.
